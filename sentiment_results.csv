Say goodbye to dullness, and hello to shine!
Softer, shinier, and healthier-looking hair is what this creamy, nourishing shampoo is all about. Enriched with Coconut Milk & Pea Peptide!
Ingredients:
• Coconut Milk – An ingredient that is rich in lipids (blend of fatty acids) and filled with vitamins, coconut milk helps enhance hair’s natural shine and restores hair moisture. Being rich in fatty acids, coconut has a high affinity for hair proteins & because of its low molecular weight, it can penetrate the hair shaft and keeps hair healthy and moisturised
• Pea Peptide – They are short chains of amino acids which act as building blocks of proteins like keratin in the hair. They help strengthen hair and smoothen out strands as well.","Applied For	Daily Care, Damage Repair, Softening & Silkening, Dryness Care, Frizz Control, Hair Shine
